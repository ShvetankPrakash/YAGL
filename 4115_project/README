The YAGL compiler (forked from MicroC compiler)

Coded in OCaml, this language is built around c-like syntax (ints,
bools, and void types, arithmetic, if-else, and while statements,
and user-defined functions) and compiles it into LLVM IR.

It needs the OCaml llvm library, which is most easily installed through opam.

Install LLVM and its development libraries, the m4 macro preprocessor,
and opam, then use opam to install llvm.

The version of the OCaml llvm library must match the version of the LLVM
system installed on your system.

YAGL currently supports print<data_type> and has generic printing print(),
which call the C library function printf().

testall.sh runs the yagl executable on each testcase (.ygl file) 
to produce a .ll file, which invokes "llc" (the LLVM compiler) to produce a 
.s (assembly) file, then invokes "cc" (the stock C compiler) to assemble 
the .s file and generate an executable. See testall.sh for details.

----- Test Suite -----
To check that all the tests are passed:

1) Invoke the docker image that Prof. Edwards provided
   (docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/home/microc -w=/home/microc columbiasedwards/plt)

2a) Run 'make clean && make test'
2b) Alternatively if you would like to simply make the compiler and run the entire
    test suite simply run 'make clean && make' 

----- FINAL DEMOS -----
To run the demos from our presentation:

1) Invoke the docker image that Prof. Edwards provided
   (docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/home/microc -w=/home/microc columbiasedwards/plt)

2) Run 'make clean && make all'

3a) Run './yagl final_demos/demo1' to get output of the social network example
3b) Run './yagl final_demos/demo2' for hello world program implemented using a graph
3c) Run './yagl final_demos/yagl_in_one_slide' for a quick overview demo

----- DEBUGGING -----
To see the generated AST, SAST, LLVM IR, and assembly code:

1) Invoke the docker image that Prof. Edwards provided
   (docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/home/microc -w=/home/microc columbiasedwards/plt)

2) Run 'make clean && make all'

3) Run './yagl_debugger tests/<file>' or './yagl final_demos/<file>'
   (Do not include .ygl file extension with <file>)
